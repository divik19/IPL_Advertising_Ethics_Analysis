**IPL Advertising Ethics Analysis**

 Domain: Sports & Entertainment     Function : Research Analytics


**Situation:**  
"Business Basics" is a business blogging platform with a strong reader base in business content. As public concern grows over the rising share of IPL advertisements by fantasy gaming and pan masala brands (over 50%), the company wants to explore both the economic power and the social/health implications of IPL 2025 advertising. Chief Editor Tony Sharma has commissioned this analysis to bring a balanced perspective on how the IPL contributes to economic growth while also posing regulatory and ethical challenges. Journalist Peter Pandey has been assigned the responsibility, supported by unstructured web-scraped data and internal datasets.

**Task:**  
The goal is to:
 - Analyze and clean the datasets: fact_ipl_advertisers, fact_revenue_demography, fact_summary_demography, and fact_ipl_central_contracts.
 - Use the "data sources" guide to better understand the context and classification of the data.
 - Develop structured insights that address two core themes:
    1. The economic footprint of the IPL.
    2. The social and health implications of current advertising practices.
 - Present findings that help Business Basics produce a data-driven editorial reflecting both opportunity and concern around IPL’s commercial ecosystem.

**Action:**  
- Cleaned and structured four unorganized datasets (fact_ipl_advertisers, fact_revenue_demography, fact_summary_demography, and fact_ipl_central_contracts) using Python, addressing inconsistencies in income ranges, population estimates, and advertiser categories.
- Developed a multi-layered analysis framework to examine IPL’s economic impact (via revenue trends, contract values, and regional engagement) and its social/health risk exposure (based on brand categories and advertising frequencies).
- Created a comprehensive Ethical Advertising Scorecard by scoring advertisers on dimensions like category risk (e.g., pan masala, fantasy apps), audience targeting, regulatory compliance, and ad frequency.
- Integrated insights into a unified Power BI dashboard, allowing exploration of advertiser influence, regional demographics, high-risk brand exposure, and player endorsement patterns.

**Result:**  
- Enabled Business Basics editorial team to publish a balanced, data-driven magazine edition covering both IPL’s economic contributions and its social/health consequences.
- Uncovered that over 58% of ads were from high-risk brand categories, concentrated in regions with high youth viewership, sparking an internal editorial on advertising ethics reform.
- Identified opportunities for IPL stakeholders to diversify advertiser portfolios and collaborate with socially responsible brands, aiding Business Basics in proposing policy-tier frameworks for future ad regulation discussions.
- Equipped the chief editor with visual tools and narrative to present at the Business & Sports Ethics Summit 2025, enhancing the publication’s credibility in business journalism.
